# Spider-Of-DBLP
This project aims to automatically crawl articles from DBLP.

GenlistByTopic.py will produce the paperlink.txt and papername.txt.

downloadP.py can only support downloading by doi and arxiv, so it will miss some url like:https://sci-hub.ren/https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.443/

download_Con.py is from the original fork from Hectoor/SimplePaperDownloador

There are many bugs, the most important is that you should create a folder to store papers manually
